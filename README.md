# odin-recipes

This project will be a basic website, using only html, with a main index page, and links to a few pages with recipes. At the end of this project, I will have demonstrated a few HTML skills, namely page creation, creation of headings and paragraphs, and use of anchor tags with relative links to link to other pages on my website.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="para">Eggs Benedict is a common American brunch dish originating in New York City.
           Consisting of an english muffin, a cured pork product, poached eggs, and
           hollandaise sauce, Eggs Benedict is commonly considered a test of a chef's 
           artistry, as it uses simple ingredients, but complex cooking methods.</p>
        <p class="para thin">The following recipe is a more upscale version, which I learned from our 
           lord and savior Gordon Ramsay himself. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3 id="subrecipe">Hollandaise</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 stick butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="subrecipe">Eggs Benedict</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 English muffin</li>
            <li>2 slices pancetta</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Hollandaise</li>
            <li>Chives (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3 id="subrecipe">Hollandaise</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by prepping a double boiler by filling a pot with about an inch of water and resting a glass bowl over top. It is imperative that the water not make contact with the glass bowl. Start the water simmering over medium low to medium heat.</li>
            <li>In a seperate pan, melt a stick of butter. Do not burn the butter. It should be kept around 114°F (45°C).</li>
            <li>Crack your eggs in the pan and whisk quickly and constantly with a large balloon whisk until eggs have thickened slightly.</li>
            <li>Very slowly stream the melted butter into the eggs while continuing to whisk vigorously.</li>
            <li>Pour your hollandaise sauce into a thermos to keep it warm while preparing the rest of your Eggs Benedict.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="subrecipe">Eggs Benedict</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fry pancetta in a dry pan over medium heat. When crisp, remove pancetta to drain on a paper towel, without draining fat from the pan.</li>
            <li>Seperate english muffin and lightly toast in pan over medium low heat.</li>
            <li>Prepare a pot of water, and set it to simmer over medium heat. Use a balloon whisk to stir the simmering water and create a vortex in the middle of the water.</li>
            <li>Crack a single egg into a ramekin and gently lower the egg into the center of the vortex to poach the egg. Continue cooking until egg resembles a ball of mozzerella, then remove and drain on a paper towel. Repeat with the other egg.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Eggs Benedict by placing a slice of pancetta on top of one half of the english muffin. Place the poached egg on top of the pancetta, and pour hollandaise sauce over top of the egg. Garnish with finely chopped chives.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lomo Saltado is a Peruvian dish consisting of tender steak and vegetables in a savory sauce served with rice and french fries. 
            Peru has a long and rich tradition of chinese cooking, owing to the prevalence of Chinese immigrants in the country dating back to the late 19th century. 
            Lomo wears its chinese influence on its sleeve, using the Chinese cooking technique of stir frying, which is implied in the name "saltado".</p>
            <p>I learned this recipe from my father in law, who grew up in Peru and came to the United States in the late 1970s.</p>

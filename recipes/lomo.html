        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lomo Saltado is a Peruvian dish consisting of tender steak and vegetables in a savory sauce served with rice and french fries. 
            Peru has a long and rich tradition of chinese cooking, owing to the prevalence of Chinese immigrants in the country dating back to the late 19th century. 
            Lomo wears its chinese influence on its sleeve, using the Chinese cooking technique of stir frying, which is implied in the name "saltado".</p>
            <p>I learned this recipe from my father in law, who grew up in Peru and came to the United States in the late 1970s.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>Salt and pepper</li>

        <h3>Cilantro Rice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup dry long grain white rice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup lime juice, or to taste</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fench Fries</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>1 liter peanut oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Lomo Saltado</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice steak, onion, tomatoes, and bell pepper into thin, even strips.</li>
            <li>Season steak with salt, pepper, and minced garlic.</li>
            <li>Heat a wok over high heat until ripping hot, then sear steak strips, cooking in batches so as to not overcrowd the pan. Set steak aside.</li>
            <li>Turn heat down to medium and add vegetables and aji paste. Stir fry until cooked through, but still a little crunchy.</li>
            <li>Add steak back to wok and stir ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Pour vinegar and soy sauce down side of wok and allow to thicken.</li>
            <li>Garnish with cilantro and serve alongside cilantro rice and french fries.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cilantro Rice</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare a pot of rice according to your chosen method. I prefer to use a rice cooker because it reliably cooks perfect rice every time.</li>
            <li>Transfer rice to a wooden bowl and fluff with a wooden spoon to cool down.</li>
            <li>Combine rice, cilantro, lime juice, salt, and pepper and serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>French Fries</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice potatoes into french fry size strips and place in a bowl of ice water until ready to fry.</li>
            <li>Heat a liter of peanut oil in a deep fryer at 350째F (175째C).</li>
            <li>Remove potatoes from water and dry with paper towels. The potato strips <strong>must</strong> be bone dry.</li>
            <li>Par-fry the potato strips for three minutes, just enough to cook through, and drain.</li>
            <li>Arrange fries on a baking sheet and freeze overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat peanut oil to 400째F (205째C).</li>
            <li>Deep fry fries for 3 minutes, until well done. Drain and serve.</li>
        </ol>

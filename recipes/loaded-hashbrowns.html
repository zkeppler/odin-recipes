        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I've had a preoccupation with diner food for a long time, and it was alwways a mystery to me how diners were able to pack so much flavor into
            something as simple as hashbrowns. As it turns out, it's the cookware. For this recipe, you're gonna need a griddle, preferably gas. I use a
            blackstone griddle, but if you're lucky enough to have a gas stove, a gas griddle works wonders. Steer clear of electric griddles - they don't get hot enough.</p>
        <p>I figured this recipe out from carefully watching cooks at a local diner prep an order of loaded hashbrowns.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 russett potato</li>
            <li>1 white onion, roughly chopped</li>

            <li>Shredded cheese</li>
        </ul>

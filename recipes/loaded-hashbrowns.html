        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="para">I've had a preoccupation with diner food for a long time, and it was alwways a mystery to me how diners were able to pack so much flavor into
            something as simple as hashbrowns. As it turns out, it's the cookware. For this recipe, you're gonna need a griddle, preferably gas. I use a
            blackstone griddle, but if you're lucky enough to have a gas stove, a gas griddle works wonders. Steer clear of electric griddles - they don't get hot enough.</p>
        <p class="para thin">I figured this recipe out from carefully watching cooks at a local diner prep an order of loaded hashbrowns.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 russett potato</li>
            <li>1 white onion, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 lb white mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>Diced ham</li>
            <li>Shredded cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and grate 1 potato, then transfer to a bowl of ice water.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes, then place potatoes in a towel and wring dry.</li>
            <li>Heat griddle to 400째 F (205 째C) and oil well.</li>
            <li>Mound potatoes up over a hot spot on the griddle and place a grill weight over top. Cook until very crispy. Flip and repeat.</li>
            <li>Turn griddle down to 350째 F (175째 C). Add all remaining ingredients except shredded cheese and cook through.</li>
            <li>Using two spatulas, chop the pile up and mix well.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a handful of shredded cheese over top and use a bowl to cover. Serve when cheese is melted.</li>
        </ol>
